In prohect 2 I had to create a C++ code that implements a real estate agency that can add and manage properties for renting. There are two types of properties: apartments and houses, and both inherit from a base class named "Locuinta." The Locuinta class includes basic information such as client name, square footage, and discount. The Apartment and Casa classes calculate the rent of their respective properties based on these values. The Agency class is used to store multiple properties and provides methods for adding and accessing them. The program includes exception handling for negative values and invalid discounts and an interactive navigation menu.
